This program takes a string and converts it into an encrypted message by shifting each letter a certain number down the alphabet. This number is also entered by the user. This system is the Caesar Cipher, used by Julius Caesar in his correspondence.

What I learned:
I learned how to use ASCII codes, they were pivotal to the process of changing numbers, because I had an inherit system of values related to each number, rather than creating one myself.
